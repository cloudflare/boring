# Low-level bindings to BoringSSL

[BoringSSL](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl) is Google's fork of OpenSSL for Chrome/Chromium and Android.

This crate builds the BoringSSL library (or optionally links a pre-built version) and generates FFI bindings for it.
It supports FIPS-compatible builds of BoringSSL, as well as Post-Quantum crypto and Raw Public Key features.

To use BoringSSL from Rust, prefer the [higher-level safe API](https://docs.rs/boring).
