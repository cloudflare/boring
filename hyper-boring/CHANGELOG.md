# Change Log

## [Unreleased]


## [v2.1.2] - 2022-09-16

### Added

* `impl Debug for MaybeHttpsStream`

## [v2.1.1] - 2021-12-16

### Changed

* Removed unnecessary `boring-sys` and `bytes` dependencies

## [v0.8.0] - 2019-12-10

### Changed

* Upgraded to hyper 0.13

## [v0.8.0-alpha.4] - 2019-09-04

### Changed

* Upgraded to hyper 0.13-alpha.4.

## [v0.8.0-alpha.1] - 2019-09-04

### Changed

* Upgraded to hyper 0.13-alpha.1.

## [v0.7.1] - 2019-03-01

### Changed

* TLSv1.3 sessions are now only used once, in accordance with the RFC's recommendation.

## [v0.7.0] - 2018-11-13

### Changed

* Upgraded `tokio-openssl` to 0.3. Handshake errors now return `openssl::ssl::HandshakeError`
    rather than `openssl::ssl::Error`.

## [v0.6.2] - 2018-11-07

### Added

* Added ALPN support. If the `h2` protocol is selected during the handshake via ALPN, the connector
    will automatically indicate that to Hyper via the `Connected::negotiated_h2` method. The
    `HttpsConnector::new` method configures ALPN to support both the `h2` and `http/1.1` protocols.
    Code using `HttpsConnector::with_connector` will need to configure ALPN manually.

## [v0.6.1] - 2018-06-13

### Changed

* `MaybeHttpsStream` now delegates `AsyncRead::read_buf` and `AsyncWrite::write_buf` to support
    readv/writev over HTTP connections.

## [v0.6.0] - 2018-06-04

### Changed

* Upgraded to hyper 0.12.
* The callback closure now takes a `&Destination` rather than a `&URI` to match what Hyper provides
    to connectors.

## [v0.5.0] - 2018-02-18

### Changed

* The `HttpsConnector::with_connector` function now takes an `SslConnectorBuilder` rather than an
    `SslConnector` due to a change in the session caching implementation. This is requried to
    properly support TLSv1.3.

## [v0.4.1] - 2018-01-11

### Changed

* Stopped enabling default features for `hyper`.

## [v0.4.0] - 2018-01-11

### Removed

* The `HttpsConnector::danger_disable_hostname_verification` method has been removed. Instead, use
    a callback which configures the `ConnectConfiguration` directly.

### Changed

* Upgraded to openssl 0.10.
* The `HttpsConnector::ssl_callback` method has been renamed to `HttpsConnector::set_callback`,
    and is passed a reference to the `ConnectConfiguration` rather than just the `SslRef`.
