//! Bindings to BoringSSL
//!
//! This crate provides a safe interface to the BoringSSL cryptography library.
//!
//! # Versioning
//!
//! ## Crate versioning
//!
//! The crate and all the related crates (FFI bindings, etc.) are released simultaneously and all
//! bumped to the same version disregard whether particular crate has any API changes or not.
//! However, semantic versioning guarantees still hold, as all the crate versions will be updated
//! based on the crate with most significant changes.
//!
//! ## BoringSSL version
//!
//! By default, the crate aims to statically link with the latest BoringSSL master branch.
//! *Note*: any BoringSSL revision bumps will be released as a major version update of all crates.
//!
//! # Compilation and linking options
//!
//! ## Environment variables
//!
//! This crate uses various environment variables to tweak how boring is built. The variables
//! are all prefixed by `BORING_BSSL_` for non-FIPS builds, and by `BORING_BSSL_FIPS_` for FIPS builds.
//!
//! ## Support for pre-built binaries or custom source
//!
//! While this crate can build BoringSSL on its own, you may want to provide pre-built binaries instead.
//! To do so, specify the environment variable `BORING_BSSL{,_FIPS}_PATH` with the path to the binaries.
//!
//! You can also provide specific headers by setting `BORING_BSSL{,_FIPS}_INCLUDE_PATH`.
//!
//! _Notes_: The crate will look for headers in the`$BORING_BSSL{,_FIPS}_INCLUDE_PATH/openssl/`
//! folder, make sure to place your headers there.
//!
//! In alternative a different path for the BoringSSL source code directory can be specified by setting
//! `BORING_BSSL{,_FIPS}_SOURCE_PATH` which will automatically be compiled during the build process.
//!
//! _Warning_: When providing a different version of BoringSSL make sure to use a compatible one, the
//! crate relies on the presence of certain functions.
//!
//! ## Building with a FIPS-validated module
//!
//! Only BoringCrypto module version `853ca1ea1168dff08011e5d42d94609cc0ca2e27`, as certified with
//! [FIPS 140-2 certificate 4407](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4407)
//! is supported by this crate. Support is enabled by this crate's `fips` feature.
//!
//! `boring-sys` comes with a test that FIPS is enabled/disabled depending on the feature flag. You can run it as follows:
//!
//! ```bash
//! $ cargo test --features fips fips::is_enabled
//! ```
//!
//! ## Linking current BoringSSL version with precompiled FIPS-validated module (`bcm.o`)
//!
//! It's possible to link latest supported version of BoringSSL with FIPS-validated crypto module
//! (`bcm.o`). To enable this compilation option one should enable `fips-link-precompiled`
//! compilation feature and provide a `BORING_BSSL_FIPS_PRECOMPILED_BCM_O` env variable with a path to the
//! precompiled FIPS-validated `bcm.o` module.
//!
//! Note that `BORING_BSSL_PRECOMPILED_BCM_O` is never used, as linking BoringSSL with precompiled non-FIPS
//! module is not supported.
//!
//! # Optional patches
//!
//! ## Raw Public Key
//!
//! The crate can be compiled with [RawPublicKey](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7250)
//! support by turning on `rpk` compilation feature.
//!
//! ## Experimental post-quantum cryptography
//!
//! The crate can be compiled with [post-quantum cryptography](https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-for-all/)
//! support by turning on `post-quantum` compilation feature.
//!
//! Upstream BoringSSL support the post-quantum hybrid key agreement `X25519Kyber768Draft00`. Most
//! users should stick to that one for now. Enabling this feature, adds a few other post-quantum key
//! agreements:
//!
//! - `X25519MLKEM768` is the successor of `X25519Kyber768Draft00`. We expect servers to switch
//!   before the end of 2024.
//! - `X25519Kyber768Draft00Old` is the same as `X25519Kyber768Draft00`, but under its old codepoint.
//! - `X25519Kyber512Draft00`. Similar to `X25519Kyber768Draft00`, but uses level 1 parameter set for
//!    Kyber. Not recommended. It's useful to test whether the shorter ClientHello upsets fewer middle
//!    boxes.
//! - `P256Kyber768Draft00`. Similar again to `X25519Kyber768Draft00`, but uses P256 as classical
//!    part. It uses a non-standard codepoint. Not recommended.
//!
//! Presently all these key agreements are deployed by Cloudflare, but we do not guarantee continued
//! support for them.
